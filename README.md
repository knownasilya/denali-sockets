# Denali Sockets

Support for real time data flow via websockets.
Currently this supports socket.io, but the intention is to support multiple web socket implementations.

## Getting Started

First install this addon using:

```sh
yarn add denali-sockets
# or
npm install --save denali-sockets
```

> From here on I'll be using `yarn` in the examples.

After installation you should have a new `app/namespaces/application.js` file which should be enough to
get started with sockets.


## Developing

1. Clone the repo down
2. `npm install`
3. `denali server`
4. Hit [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)


## Tests

```sh
$ denali test
```
